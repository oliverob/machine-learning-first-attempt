This was my first attempt at exploring machine learning. I wrote an implementation of a simple neural network from just numpy, it works okay and I have achieved a training and test accuracy of 98% and 97% respectively – however I have not yet implemented any regularization or early stopping which will hopefully improve it – it would also need to be optimised if I wanted to use it on a larger dataset
